TO change our VNC password we can do:
$ vncpasswd
This will prompt you to create a strong password that you will need to remember for connecting to your linux academy lab server via a VNC Client Application.

Before proceeding reboot your linux server.
After a few minutes you can ssh back to your server.

In order to connect to the VNC session you will need a VNC viewer application.
Realvnc.com offers free viewers.  They have installers for linux, windows, and OSX.

After downloading and installing the VNC viewer to connect to your lab server IP followed by the port.
The port for this VNC session should be :5901

So for example 192.192.192.192:5901 is what you would use to connect to your lab server if your IP was 192.192.192.192 *Please note use your lab server IP as shown in the Linux Academy control panel
